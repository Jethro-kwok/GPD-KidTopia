Garbage man 
Working as a garbage man is a very exhausting job and pays very little, having to go around HDB blocks collecting the smelly garbage from HDBs garbage chutes, sweep very small littered objects etc. After all, who has the time to take care of a baby plus with my salary I donâ€™t think I can provide for both of us.

Fast-food worker
Working as a fast food server is not the best job in the world, having to constantly try and cover all bases of the work due to the shortage of staff can be tiring. Moreover, with that there is a need to cover more shifts at work adds on exhaustion. My free time is also very limited thus by adding a baby to the equation, I have no time to take care of the baby at all.

Office worker
Working as an office worker, I have a 9-5 job every day stamping documents. This job does pay decently well for me to enjoy myself when I have time off but the problem is that it can be quite monotonous as everyday is basically the same and for weekends overtime and having to answer to urgent calls. I do not think I have the time to and energy to take care of a baby plus I do not want to spend whatever freedom I have left on taking care of a baby.

Safety Inspector
Working as a safety Inspector is a very dangerous job, strictly following the rules is must in order to ensure personal safety and to live to see another day. Moreover, having a baby is not a very good decision one working with hazards may be harmful towards the baby and the baby bonus does not help as it is not enough to buy the necessities and if my baby were to get sick it would be extra cost to see a doctor.
